        // Quit, Skip forward, skip backwards, replay the current song, and list the songs in the playlist.
        // A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that

        // started tracking the direction we were going in.
        // As an optional extra, provide an option to remove the song from the playlist.
